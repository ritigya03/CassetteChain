# CassetteChain
CassetteChain 🎧💿 — a fun yet powerful Web3 project where Spotify playlists become NFTs, paired with secret messages, and sent as unique digital keepsakes to friends.
Inspired by a personal moment, built with beginner-level Web3/backend knowledge — and a LOT of sleepless nights, debugging, experimenting, and learning along the way.


- 🎧 Connect MetaMask + Spotify
- 🌈 Browse cute & aesthetic playlists
- 📝 Pick one, add a secret message & mint it as an NFT
- 📬 Send it to your friend’s wallet address
- ✨ With one click, they’re taken to a beautiful page → listen to the playlist → and the secret message reveals over time 🎁

## 💡 Why NFTs & Blockchain?
- True digital ownership — your gift lives on-chain, not in a database
- Decentralized memory sharing — no middlemen
- Time-revealed secrets — encoded into smart contracts
- Metadata + media stored via IPFS — no broken links
- Wallet-based access — portable, secure, personal
- Forever proof of playlists, vibes, and messages
